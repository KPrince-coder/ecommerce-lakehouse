   - Product performance metrics
   - Department-level sales analysis
   - Product reorder rates and patterns
   - Inventory and product catalog analysis

2. **Order Analytics**
   - Daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends
   - Order value distribution
   - Time-of-day and day-of-week patterns
   - Payment method analysis

3. **Customer Insights**
   - Customer purchase patterns
   - Repeat purchase behavior
   - Customer segmentation
   - Cross-selling and up-selling opportunities

## Data Sources

The e-commerce platform generates three primary datasets:

1. **Products Data**
   - Product catalog information
   - Department and category classifications
   - Product attributes and metadata

2. **Orders Data**
   - Order header information
   - Customer purchase details
   - Order timestamps and amounts

3. **Order Items Data**
   - Line-item details for each order
   - Product quantities and reorder flags
   - Cart position and order sequence

These datasets will be processed through the Lakehouse architecture to enable comprehensive analytics and business intelligence.
