# E-Commerce Lakehouse Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the AWS Lakehouse architecture implementation for e-commerce transaction data.

## Documentation Structure

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Requirements](requirements.md) | Business requirements, AWS services, and justification for service selection |
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | Detailed architecture diagrams and component descriptions |
| [Data Model](data_model.md) | Data schema, partitioning strategies, and table relationships |
| [ETL Processes](etl_processes.md) | ETL processes for Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers |
| [Data Quality](data_quality.md) | Data validation and quality check procedures |
| [Deployment](deployment.md) | CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions |

## Diagrams

All architecture and process diagrams are created using Mermaid, which can be rendered directly in GitHub and other Markdown viewers that support Mermaid syntax.

## Implementation Details

This documentation provides technical details for implementing a production-grade Lakehouse architecture on AWS for e-commerce transaction data. The architecture follows the medallion design pattern with Bronze, Silver, and Gold data layers, each serving a specific purpose in the data refinement process.

## AWS Services

The implementation leverages the following AWS services:

- Amazon S3 for data storage
- AWS Glue for ETL processing
- Delta Lake for ACID-compliant table format
- AWS Step Functions for orchestration
- AWS Glue Data Catalog for metadata management
- Amazon Athena for SQL-based analytics
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation

## Getting Started

To understand the complete architecture, start with the [Architecture](architecture.md) document, which provides a high-level overview of the system. Then, explore the specific components based on your area of interest:

- For data engineers: [Data Model](data_model.md) and [ETL Processes](etl_processes.md)
- For data quality engineers: [Data Quality](data_quality.md)
- For DevOps engineers: [Deployment](deployment.md)
- For solution architects: [Requirements](requirements.md) and [Architecture](architecture.md)
